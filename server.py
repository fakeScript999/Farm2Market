It is common knowledge that chopping onions causes watery eyes. However, onions may also provide potential health benefits. These may include reducing the risk of several types of cancer, improving mood, and maintaining skin and hair health.

One 58 gram (g) lemon can provide over 30 milligrams (mg) of vitamin C. Vitamin C is essential for health, and a deficiency can lead to health problems. The early explorers knew this and took lemons on their long voyages to help prevent or treat scurvy, a life threatening condition that was common among sailors''', 50, 100 )

The fibres can be made into a wide variety of fabrics ranging from lightweight voiles and laces to heavy sailcloths and thick-piled velveteens, suitable for a great variety of wearing apparel, home furnishings, and industrial uses. Cotton fabrics can be extremely durable and resistant to abrasion. Cotton accepts many dyes, is usually washable, and can be ironed at relatively high temperatures. It is comfortable to wear because it absorbs and releases moisture quickly. When warmth is desired, it can be napped, a process giving the fabric a downy surface. ''', 50, 100 )

It’s the seed of a plant in the grass family, native to Central America but grown in countless varieties worldwide. Popcorn and sweet corn are popular varieties, but refined corn products are also widely consumed, frequently as ingredients in processed food. Whole-grain corn is as healthy as any cereal grain, as it’s rich in fiber and many vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.''', 50, 100)

Labelled as a vegetable for nutritional purposes, tomatoes are a good source of vitamin C and the phytochemical lycopene. The fruits are commonly eaten raw in salads, served as a cooked vegetable, used as an ingredient of various prepared dishes, and pickled. Additionally, a large percentage of the world’s tomato crop is used for processing; products include canned tomatoes, tomato juice, ketchup, puree, paste, and “sun-dried” tomatoes or dehydrated pulp.''', 50, 100 )

This is a type of plant food with a fleshy outer section that surrounds a shell, or pit. This pit contains a seed. Olives, dates, and coconuts are also part of this family. There are many different kinds of mango. They vary in color, shape, flavor, and seed size. Although mango skin can be green, red, yellow, or orange, its inner flesh is mostly golden yellow.''', 50, 100)

val9 = (10, 'Bananas', '''Bananas are rich in potassium and fiber. They may help prevent asthma, cancer, high blood pressure, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and digestive problems.

val10 = (11, 'Carrots', '''Carrots are rich in vitamins, minerals, and fiber. They are also a good source of antioxidants. Antioxidants are nutrients present in plant-based foods. They help the body remove free radicals, unstable molecules that can cause cell damage if too many accumulate in the body. Free radicals result from natural processes and environmental pressures. The body can eliminate many free radicals naturally, but dietary antioxidants can help, especially when the oxidant load is high''', 50, 100)
